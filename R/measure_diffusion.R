#' Diffusion metrics for networks
#' @description
#'   These functions allow measurement of various features of
#'   a diffusion process:
#'   
#'   - `network_transmissibility()`: Measures the average transmissibility observed
#'   in a diffusion simulation, or the number of new infections over
#'   the number of susceptible nodes
#'   - `network_infection_length()`: Measures the average number of time steps 
#'   nodes remain infected once they become infected
#'   - `network_reproduction()`: Measures the observed reproductive number
#'   in a diffusion simulation as the network's transmissibility over
#'   the network's average infection length
#'   - `network_immunity`: Measures the proportion of nodes that would need
#'   to be protected through vaccination, isolation, or recovery for herd immunity to be reached 
#' @param diff_model A valid network diffusion model,
#'   as created by `as_diffusion()` or `play_diffusion()`.

#' @rdname net_diffusion 
#' @section Transmissibility: 
#'   `network_transmissibility()` measures how many directly susceptible nodes
#'   each infected node will infect in each time period, on average.
#'   That is:
#'   \deqn{T = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{i_{j}}{s_{j}}}
#'   where \eqn{i} is the number of new infections in each time period, \eqn{j \in n},
#'   and \eqn{s} is the number of nodes that could have been infected in that time period
#'   (note that \eqn{s \neq S}, or 
#'   the number of nodes that are susceptible in the population).
#'   \eqn{T} can be interpreted as the proportion of susceptible nodes that are
#'   infected at each time period.
#' @examples
#'   # To calculate the average transmissibility for a given diffusion model
#'   network_transmissibility(smeg_diff)
#' @export
network_transmissibility <- function(diff_model){
  out <- diff_model$I_new/diff_model$s
  out <- out[-1]
  out <- out[!is.infinite(out)]
  out <- out[!is.nan(out)]
  make_network_measure(mean(out, na.rm = TRUE),
                       attr(diff_model, "network"))
}

#' @rdname net_diffusion 
#' @section Infection length: 
#'   `network_infection_length()` measures the average number of time steps that
#'   nodes in a network remain infected.
#'   Note that in a diffusion model without recovery, average infection length
#'   will be infinite.
#'   This will also be the case where there is right censoring.
#'   The longer nodes remain infected, the longer they can infect others.
#' @examples
#'   # To calculate the average infection length for a given diffusion model
#'   network_infection_length(smeg_diff)
#' @export
network_infection_length <- function(diff_model){
  make_network_measure(mean(node_infection_length(diff_model), na.rm = TRUE),
                       attr(diff_model, "network"))
}

#' @rdname net_diffusion 
#' @section Reproduction number: 
#'   `network_reproduction()` measures a given diffusion's reproductive number.
#'   Here it is calculated as:
#'   \deqn{R = \min\left(\frac{T}{1/IL}, \bar{k}\right)}
#'   where \eqn{T} is the observed transmissibility in a diffusion
#'   and \eqn{IL} is the observed infection length in a diffusion.
#'   Since \eqn{IL} can be infinite where there is no recovery
#'   or there is right censoring,
#'   and since network structure places an upper limit on how many
#'   nodes each node may further infect (their degree),
#'   this function returns the minimum of \eqn{R_0}
#'   and the network's average degree.
#'   
#'   Interpretation of the reproduction number is oriented around R = 1.
#'   Where \eqn{R > 1}, the 'disease' will 'infect' more and more
#'   nodes in the network.
#'   Where \eqn{R < 1}, the 'disease' will not sustain itself and eventually
#'   die out.
#'   Where \eqn{R = 1}, the 'disease' will continue as endemic,
#'   if conditions allow.
#' @examples
#'   # To calculate the reproduction number for a given diffusion model
#'   network_reproduction(smeg_diff)
#' @export
network_reproduction <- function(diff_model){
  net <- attr(diff_model, "network")
  out <- network_transmissibility(diff_model)/
    (1/network_infection_length(diff_model))
  out <- min(out, mean(node_degree(net, normalized = FALSE)))
  make_network_measure(out, net)
}

#' @rdname net_diffusion 
#' @section Herd immunity: 
#'   `network_immunity()` estimates the proportion of a network
#'   that need to be protected from infection for herd immunity
#'   to be achieved.
#'   This is known as the Herd Immunity Threshold or HIT:
#'   \deqn{1 - \frac{1}{R}}
#'   where \eqn{R} is the reproduction number from `network_reproduction()`.
#'   The HIT indicates the threshold at which
#'   the reduction of susceptible members of the network means
#'   that infections will no longer keep increasing.
#'   Note that there may still be more infections after this threshold has been reached,
#'   but there should be fewer and fewer.
#'   These excess infections are called the _overshoot_.
#'   This function does _not_ take into account the structure
#'   of the network, instead using the average degree.
#'   
#'   Interpretation is quite straightforward.
#'   A HIT or immunity score of 0.75 would mean that 75% of the nodes in the network
#'   would need to be vaccinated or otherwise protected to achieve herd immunity.
#'   To identify how many nodes this would be, multiply this proportion with the number
#'   of nodes in the network. 
#' @examples
#'   # Calculating the proportion required to achieve herd immunity
#'   network_immunity(smeg_diff)
#'   # To find the number of nodes to be vaccinated
#'   ceiling(network_immunity(smeg_diff) * manynet::network_nodes(smeg))
#' @export
network_immunity <- function(diff_model){
  net <- attr(diff_model, "network")
  out <- 1 - 1/network_reproduction(diff_model)
  make_network_measure(out, net)
}

#'   These functions allow measurement of various features of
#'   a diffusion process:

#'   nodes adopt/become infected
#'   - `node_adopter()`: Classifies membership of nodes into diffusion categories

#'   a given mark

#' @section Adoption time:

#' @section Adopter class: 
#'   `node_adopter()` classifies the nodes involved in a diffusion
#'   by where on the distribution of adopters they fell.
#'   Valente (1995) defines five memberships:
#'   
#'   - _Early adopter_: those with an adoption time less than 
#'   the average adoption time minus one standard deviation of adoptions times
#'   - _Early majority_: those with an adoption time between
#'   the average adoption time and 
#'   the average adoption time minus one standard deviation of adoptions times
#'   - _Late majority_: those with an adoption time between
#'   the average adoption time and 
#'   the average adoption time plus one standard deviation of adoptions times
#'   - _Laggard_: those with an adoption time greater than 
#'   the average adoption time plus one standard deviation of adoptions times
#'   - _Non-adopter_: those without an adoption time,
#'   i.e. never adopted
#' @examples
#'   # To classify nodes by their position in the adoption curve

#'   exposure they had when they were infected.
#'   This inference is of course imperfect,
#'   especially where there is a sudden increase in exposure,
#'   but it can be used heuristically.

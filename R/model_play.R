#' Functions to play games on networks
#' @inheritParams is
#' @param seeds A valid mark vector the length of the
#'   number of nodes in the network.
#' @param thresholds A numeric vector indicating the thresholds
#'   each node has. By default 1.
#'   A single number means a generic threshold;
#'   for thresholds that vary among the population please use a vector
#'   the length of the number of nodes in the network.
#'   If 1 or larger, the threshold is interpreted as a simple count
#'   of the number of contacts/exposures sufficient for infection.
#'   If less than 1, the threshold is interpreted as complex,
#'   where the threshold concerns the proportion of contacts.
#' @param transmissibility The transmission rate probability,
#'   \eqn{\beta}.
#'   By default 1, which means any node for which the threshold is met
#'   or exceeded will become infected.
#'   Anything lower means a correspondingly lower probability of adoption,
#'   even when the threshold is met or exceeded.
#' @param recovery The probability those who are infected
#'   recover, \eqn{\gamma}.
#'   For example, if infected individuals take, on average, 
#'   four days to recover, then \eqn{\gamma = 0.25}.
#'   By default 0, which means there is no recovery (i.e. an SI model).
#'   Anything higher results in an SIR model.
#' @param latency The inverse probability those who have been exposed
#'   become infectious (infected), \eqn{\sigma} or \eqn{\kappa}.
#'   For example, if exposed individuals take, on average, 
#'   four days to become infectious, then \eqn{\sigma = 0.75} (1/1-0.75 = 1/0.25 = 4).
#'   By default 0, which means those exposed become immediately infectious (i.e. an SI model).
#'   Anything higher results in e.g. a SEI model.
#' @param waning The probability those who are recovered 
#'   become susceptible again, \eqn{\xi}.
#'   For example, if recovered individuals take, on average,
#'   four days to lose their immunity, then \eqn{\xi = 0.25}.
#'   By default 0, which means any recovered individuals retain lifelong immunity (i.e. an SIR model).
#'   Anything higher results in e.g. a SIRS model.
#'   \eqn{\xi = 1} would mean there is no period of immunity, e.g. an SIS model.
#' @param immune A logical or numeric vector identifying nodes
#'   that begin the diffusion process as already recovered.
#'   This could be interpreted as those who are vaccinated or equivalent.
#'   Note however that a waning parameter will affect these nodes too.
#'   By default NULL, indicating that no nodes begin immune.
#' @param steps The number of steps forward in the diffusion to play.
#'   By default the number of nodes in the network.
#'   If `steps = Inf` then the diffusion process will continue until
#'   there are no new infections or all nodes are infected.

#' @describeIn play Playing Schelling segregation on networks.
#' @param attribute A string naming some nodal attribute in the network.
#'   Currently only tested for binary attributes.
#' @param heterophily A score ranging between -1 and 1 as a threshold for 
#'   how heterophilous nodes will accept their neighbours to be.
#'   A single proportion means this threshold is shared by all nodes,
#'   but it can also be a vector the same length of the nodes in the network
#'   for issuing different thresholds to different nodes.
#'   By default this is 0, meaning nodes will be dissatisfied if more than half
#'   of their neighbours differ on the given attribute.
#' @param who_moves One of the following options:
#'   "ordered" (the default) checks each node in turn for whether they are
#'   dissatisfied and there is an available space that they can move to,
#'   "random" will check a node at random, 
#'   and "most_dissatisfied" will check (one of) the most dissatisfied nodes first.
#' @param choice_function One of the following options:
#'   "satisficing" (the default) will move the node to any coordinates that satisfy
#'   their heterophily threshold,
#'   "optimising" will move the node to coordinates that are most homophilous,
#'   and "minimising" distance will move the node to the next nearest unoccupied coordinates.

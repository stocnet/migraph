  - title: "Marks"
    desc: |
      Functions for identifying properties of graphs, nodes or ties,
      all returning logical scalars or vectors.
      Note that all `node_` and `tie_` measures return a single vector
      so that they can be added directly to graph objects.
      `network_` measures return one or, in some cases of two-mode measures,
      two values.

      Functions for measuring multimodal networks,
      all returning numeric scalars or vectors.
      Note that all `node_` and `tie_` measures return a single vector
      so that they can be added directly to graph objects.
      `network_` measures return one or, in some cases of two-mode measures,
      two values.

  - title: "Motifs"
    desc: |
      Functions for calculating subgraphs in multimodal networks.
      These functions have an additional dimension than `node_` and `network_`
      measures and marks that capture the different motifs surveyed.

  - title: "Memberships"
    desc: |
      Functions for identifying community, cluster, or class memberships
      in partitions within multimodal networks.
      They return integer vectors the length of the nodes in the network.

      The package contains multimodal, multilevel, and multiplex network data,
      used in the book _Multimodal Political Networks_ (prefixed with `mpn_`).

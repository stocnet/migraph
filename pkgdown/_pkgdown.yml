  - title: "Measures"
    desc: |
      Functions for measuring networks and returning a numeric vector or value.
      Note that all `node_` and `tie_` measures return a single vector
      so that they can be added directly to graph objects.
      `network_` measures return one or, in some cases of two-mode measures,
      two values.

  - title: "Motifs"
    desc: |
      Functions for calculating subgraphs in multimodal networks.
      These functions have an additional dimension than `node_` and `network_`
      measures and marks that capture the different motifs surveyed.
    contents:
      - ends_with("_census")
  - title: "Memberships"
    desc: |
      Functions for identifying community, cluster, or class memberships
      in partitions within multimodal networks.
      They return integer vectors the length of the nodes in the network.

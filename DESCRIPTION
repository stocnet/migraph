Package: migraph
Title: Inferential Methods for Multimodal and Other Networks 
Version: 1.5.1
Date: 2025-06-20
Description: A set of tools for testing networks.
   It includes functions for univariate and multivariate 
   conditional uniform graph and quadratic assignment procedure testing,
   and network regression.
   The package is a complement to 
   'Multimodal Political Networks' (2021, ISBN:9781108985000),
   and includes various datasets used in the book.
   Built on the 'manynet' package, all functions operate with matrices, 
   edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph' objects,
   and on one-mode and two-mode (bipartite) networks.

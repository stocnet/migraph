<div id="section-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The ergm package contains several network data sets for practice
examples. Today, we’re going to use data on florentine marriage
ties.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ergm-data"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>data(package=&#39;ergm&#39;) # tells us the datasets in our packages
data(florentine) # loads flomarriage and flobusiness data
flomarriage # Data on marriage alliances among Renaissance Florentine families
?florentine # You can see more information about the attributes in the help file.</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>We see 16 nodes and 20 edges in this undirected network. Let’s get a
little more information about the network. What is this network’s
density? What attributes are attached to the nodes of this network that
we might use in modelling?</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="density" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>net_density(flomarriage)

</div>
<p>There are a few attributes for the nodes: priorates, totalties,
wealth. All 3 are numeric valued attributes.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-visualisation" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualisation</h3>
<p>Now, let’s visualise this network (with labels), and sizing the nodes
by their wealth. What do you observe? Describe the network in terms of
configurations.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="vis-flomarriage"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>graphr(flomarriage, node_size = &quot;wealth&quot;)
as_tidygraph(flomarriage) %&gt;% mutate_nodes(Degree = node_deg()) %&gt;%  
  mutate_ties(Triangles = tie_is_triangular()) %&gt;% 
  graphr(node_size = &quot;Degree&quot;, edge_color = &quot;Triangles&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Network configurations are small patterns of ties within the graph or
subgraphs, which are sometimes referred to as network motifs (Milo et
al. 2002 in Lubell et al. 2014, p. 23). If a configuration represents an
outcome of some social process occurring within the network, then that
configuration occurring at a higher frequency in the observed network
than expected by chance once other possibly relevant processes are
controlled can be viewed as evidence for such a process/mechanism.</p>
<p>We see there is one isolate and a giant component, some nodes have
more ties (Medici, Strozzi) and others are pendants, and it looks like
there are several triangles.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-bernoulli-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Bernoulli model</h2>
<p>An ERG model is run from the
<code>ergm' package with the following syntax:</code>ergm(dependentnetwork
~ term1 + term2 + …)`</p>
<p>This is a similar syntax to running regressions and other models in
R. We begin a simple model of just one term estimating the number of
edges/ties. This is called a Bernoulli or Erdos-Renyi model. We assign
it to keep the results as an object:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="flombern" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>flom.bern &lt;- ergm(flomarriage ~ edges)  
tidy(flom.bern) # To return the estimated coefficients, with p-values etc.
glance(flom.bern, deviance = TRUE) # To collect the deviance, AIC and BIC, etc.</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>These outputs tell us:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the parameter estimate (-1.6094), standard error (0.2449), and
p-values with typical significance codes (&lt;1e-04 ***)</li>
<li>the loglikelihood, deviance, AIC(110.1) and BIC (112.9) based upon
them (discussed in Hunter and Handcock, 2006).</li>
</ol>
<div id="section-so-what-is-aicbic" class="section level3">
<h3>So what is AIC/BIC?</h3>
<p>The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) estimates how much information
is lost in the process of modelling some data. It is calculated from the
likelihood of all the observations under the model and the number of
parameters in the model. Since it thereby rewards fit but penalises for
model complexity, it not only helps us guard against overfitting, but
also helps compare model specifications fit to the same observed data.
Basically: pick the model with the lowest AIC.</p>
<p>Otherwise very similar to AIC, BIC penalises model complexity more
severely. Downside: it is likely to favour very simple models,
especially for smaller, less representative training datasets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-interpreting-results" class="section level2">
<h2>Interpreting results</h2>
<p>How to interpret the results from this model, shown below for
convenience?</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="flombee" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>tidy(flom.bern)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Interpreting results from a logistic regression can be tricky,
because the relationship between the predictor(s) and response variable
is non-linear. Here I wish to introduce you to a few options.</p>
<div id="section-log-odds" class="section level3">
<h3>Log-Odds</h3>
<p>The first option is to try and interpret the log-odds coefficients
directly. The estimates from logistic regression characterize the
relationship between the predictor and response variable on a log-odds
scale. Since there is only one term in this model, and it is
<code>edges</code>, this means that the <em>log-odds</em> of a tie
forming between any two nodes in the network is -1.6094.</p>
<p>Er, what? What does that mean? Turns out there is no real intuitive
way to interpret log-odds. Moreover, as we will later see, in network
models, effects often overlap, which mean that instead of interpreting
the effect of a one-unit change in <span
class="math inline">\(X_k\)</span> on the log-odds of <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we need to consider the combined
effect of changes in multiple <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>s on
the log-odds of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-sign-ificance" class="section level3">
<h3>Sign-ificance</h3>
<p>One option for interpretation is what I call “sign-ificance”. This
involves obtaining what information we can from this table of results.
There are two key pieces of information available:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <em>sign</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is
either:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>+: (increases in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) increases
<span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y = 1)\)</span></li>
<li>-: (increases in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) decreases
<span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y = 1)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <em>p</em>-value tells us whether (and to what extent) <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> statistically differentiable from
zero</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>small <em>p</em>-value (e.g. &lt; 0.05): unlikely to have occurred
by chance</li>
<li>large <em>p</em>-value (e.g. &gt; 0.05): could have occurred by
chance</li>
</ul>
<p>Together this is sufficient for hypothesis-testing: it tells us
whether there is a “signal” for a pattern in the data that goes in the
same direction as hypothesised and unlikely to appear just by chance.
Therefore common to see articles using this approach where authors are
only focused on testing a particular hypothesis, and helps avoid
problems with using odds-ratios (and log-odds) to compare effect sizes
within and across models (see below).</p>

<div id="signfq-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

</div>
</div>
<p>However, since there is no direct, intuitive way to interpret the
log-odds coefficients substantively and among each other, this is not
the most useful way to present results such that e.g. policy-makers know
what to expect.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-odds-ratios" class="section level3">
<h3>Odds Ratios</h3>
<p>Another approach is to transform the logit’s log-odds coefficients
into something more intuitive to support substantive interpretation.
Recall from Stats I that odds are a different way of thinking about
probability. The <em>odds ratio</em> is the ratio of the odds of an
event to the odds of another thing happening, or a change in the odds of
<span class="math inline">\(Pr(Y=1)\)</span> associated with a one unit
change in the covariate.</p>
<p>We can obtain odds ratios by simply exponentiating logistic
regression coefficients:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Odds Ratio} =
\exp(\hat\beta_k\delta)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the change in
<span class="math inline">\(X_k\)</span> (usually 1 unit). It is
straightforward enough to obtain odds ratios in R, but there is also an
option to obtain odds ratios instead of the log-odds directly in the
<code>tidy()</code> function.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="oddsratio"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>exp(coef(flom.bern)) # 0.2
tidy(flom.bern, exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE) # To return the odds ratios, with confidence intervals etc.</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Odds are much more intuitive to interpret than log-odds. Odds range
from 0 to \(\) (but never negative). Essentially, if the odds ratio is
1:1, then event and non-event equally likely. If odds ratio greater than
1, then event more likely than non-event. If odds ratio less than 1,
then event less likely than non-event. In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>OR&gt;1: \((Y=1) &gt; (Y=0)\)</li>
<li>OR&lt;1: \((Y=1) &lt; (Y=0)\)</li>
<li>OR=1: \((Y=1) = (Y=0)\)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-predicted-probabilities" class="section level3">
<h3>Predicted Probabilities</h3>
<p>Yet, what we really care about, in most cases, is not the odds of an
event per se, but the effect (of changes in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) on the <em>probability</em> of the
actual event of interest. To obtain probabilities for logistic models is
a bit more involved than with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
though, since effect of covariates is linear only with respect to the
log-odds, not <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> itself. Because
model nonlinear, real net effect of a change in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> depends on the constant, other <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>s and their parameter estimates. Unlike
in a linear regression model, the first derivative of our (binary) logit
function depends on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and \(\):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[  \frac{\partial\Pr(\hat{Y}_i =
1)}{\partial X_k} \equiv \lambda(X) = \frac{\exp(X_i\hat\beta)}{[1 +
\exp(X_i\hat\beta)]^2}\hat\beta_k \]</span></p>
<p>Practically, this means that if you’re interested in the effect of a
one-unit change in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(Pr(Y_i = 1)\)</span>, how much change there is
depends critically on “where you are on the curve”.</p>
<p><img src="ergm_files/figure-html/predprobplot-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>This means we need to calculate predicted probabilities of <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at specific values of key predictors.
In our simple Bernoulli model, we’re modelling only the number of edges,
and so we only need to condition our predicted probabilities on this one
variable. We can calculate the probability of a tie forming between any
two actors as follows, indicating the addition of a tie by increasing
the edges count by 1 (later there is an example of how to do this for
more complex models with multiple variables). However, we can also
obtain this information by using the handy <code>predict()</code>
function. We can simply pass data on our independent variables, either
in-sample, out-of-sample, or totally-made-up, to <code>predict()</code>
and see what probability of a 1 would be predicted by the model.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="predprob" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>exp(coef(flom.bern)) / (1 + exp(coef(flom.bern)))
adj &lt;- predict(flom.bern, output = &quot;matrix&quot;)
adj[is.na(adj)] &lt;- 1
adj * t(adj)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>We can see here an estimated probability of a tie forming between any
two actors of 0.1666667. Wait, where have we seen this number before?
This is the same number that we obtained for the density of the network
(0.1666667).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>So, interpreting ERGM results can be a little tricky, but for now
remember three points:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Nearly all of these approaches require one to be cognizant of “where
we are on the curve”.</li>
<li>When it comes to interpretation, a picture really is often more
valuable than text or tables, and can help guard against
misinterpretation.</li>
<li>With very rare exceptions, never a good idea to present quantities
of interest without their associated measures of uncertainty.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-assessing-goodness-of-fit" class="section level2">
<h2>Assessing goodness-of-Fit</h2>
<div id="section-simulating" class="section level3">
<h3>Simulating</h3>
<p>So we have a Bernoulli model for the Florentine marriage network.
Once we have estimated the coefficients of an ERGM, the model is
completely specified. It defines a probability distribution across all
networks of this size. But is this a <em>good</em> model? If the model
is a good fit to the observed data, then networks drawn from this
distribution will be likely to “resemble” the observed data. To see
examples of networks drawn from this distribution we use
<code>simulate()</code>:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="flom-sim" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>flom.bern.sim &lt;- simulate(flom.bern)
graphr(flomarriage) + ggtitle(&quot;Observed&quot;) +
  graphr(flom.bern.sim) + ggtitle(&quot;Simulated&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>So using <code>simulate()</code>, we get a network drawn from the
distribution of networks generated by our Bernoulli model. As such, we
can expect it to look similar to the observed network in some ways.
Since the Bernoulli model is generating networks of similar density on
the same number of nodes, these features will be fairly well captured.
Yet you may see the number of isolates, degree distribution, geodesic
distances, and appearances of triangles all change.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-gofing" class="section level3">
<h3>GOFing</h3>
<p>What happens if you run the chunk above again? And again? Do they
look the same? Because each simulation looks a bit different, we should
try and simulate many, and then examine whether features of the observed
network are being well-captured <em>in general</em>. We could just
simulate many networks, <code>simulate(flom.bern, nsim=100)</code>, and
then analyse them according to various network statistics of interest,
but <code>{ergm}</code> also has a function – <code>gof()</code> – that
does this for us. Let’s test for all the normal structural features:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="flom-gof" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>(flom.bern.gof &lt;- gof(flom.bern,  GOF = ~ distance + degree + espartners))
plot(flom.bern.gof, statistic = &quot;dist&quot;) # geodesic distances
plot(flom.bern.gof, statistic = &quot;deg&quot;) # degree distribution
plot(flom.bern.gof, statistic = &quot;espart&quot;) # edgewise shared partners
# plot(flom.bern.gof, statistic = &quot;triadcensus&quot;) # geodesic distances</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>These plots compare the observed and simulated networks on various
auxiliary network statistics such as the degree distribution, geodesic
distances, and edgewise shared partners. The thick red (or otherwise
highlighted) line annotated with numbers represent the observed
statistics. Box/whisker and violin plots show the distribution of the
statistic across the simulated networks.</p>
<p>Looking at the plots, we see that the model did not do a very good
job at predicting the network structure. While the geodesic distances
were fairly well captured (this is easy in a small network like this),
we can see some over- and under-estimation of the degree distribution
and edgewise shared partners.</p>
<p>What does this mean for our Bernoulli model? This model was not
great. We only had one covariate (edges) and so just modelled the
unconditional probability of a tie appearing (anywhere…). We should add
covariates that may better explain the degree level and triangle
formation/clustering we see in our network. We need additional
modelling!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-markov-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Markov model</h2>
<p><img src="ergm_files/figure-html/visflo2-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Let’s review what we know about the marriage network to get a better
fit. There are some nodes with more activity (higher degree) in this
network than others, and some triangle configurations appear. Yet our
Bernoulli model (unsurprisingly) did not capture these features well. It
overestimated nodes with a degree of two (there are actually only two,
but the model is expecting around four), and underestimated nodes with
degrees of one (there are four pendants, whereas the model expects
around three) or three (the model expects around 4, but six are
observed). While the Bernoulli model got the density perfectly right,
duh, it seems that it is not capturing other features of the network of
interest. Indeed, most social network analysts would find this
unsurprising, as they consider social ties more than just random
chance.</p>
<div id="section-convergence" class="section level3">
<h3>Convergence</h3>
<p>Since the Bernoulli model was misjudging “clustering”, let’s add a
term often thought to be a measure of “clustering”: the number of
completed <code>triangle</code>s. Because this model involves broader
dependencies, the estimation draws on MCMC and is thus stochastic. This
means that your output may differ slightly.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="flom-markov"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>flom.mark1 &lt;- ergm(flomarriage ~ edges + triangle) 
# Add verbose=T to watch for the convergence test p-value and 
# log-likelihood improvement to go down!
plot(flom.mark1)
tidy(flom.mark1)
glance(flom.mark1)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>First, the console output reports that the estimation procedure has
converged on stable estimates with 99% confidence (p-value &lt; 0.0001).
You can also visually check convergence by plotting the model object. In
the plot, we see that the log-likelihood stabilises over time,
indicating convergence.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-interpretation" class="section level3">
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>How do we interpret the coefficients now that the model is more
complex? First, we can (seemingly) ignore the edges/intercept now, even
if significant, as it will just be counterbalancing the other effects in
the model. In the results, we see that the MCML estimate for triangles
is not statistically significant. But if we try and interpret it anyway,
for the practice, we see that we cannot completely ignore the edges
coefficient, <em>because</em> it is part of the story of when and where
ties form. For endogenous effects relating to the structure of the
network, the coefficients need to be interpreted <em>with</em> the
coefficient of the edges (the intercept). For exogenous effects (eg. the
monadic covariate ‘wealth’ later), the coefficients can be interpreted
separately. An extra tie is perhaps not <em>just</em> an extra tie, but
could also create one or more triangles, and an extra triangle will
always create an extra tie, etc. So it depends…:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the tie considered will not add any triangles to the network,
log-odds are: Edges<br />
</li>
<li>if it will add one triangle to the network, log-odds are: Edges +
Triangle<br />
</li>
<li>if it will add two triangles to the network, log-odds are: Edges +
Triangle x 2 and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we need to think about working out the probabilities based on the
tie’s context:</p>

<p>So far we have (mostly) fitted a model to the observed network using
only structural effects. But we are often interested in these effects on
top of traditional explanations, or as controls for those traditional
explanations. Below consider the effect of two potential explanations:
money (the nodal covariate <code>nodecov(wealth)</code>) and the related
business network (<code>dyadcov(flobusiness)</code>).</p>

<h2>Social circuit models</h2>
<div id="section-new-dataset" class="section level3">
<h3>New dataset</h3>
<p>The Florentine dataset was relatively easy to fit. Sometimes social
networks can be considerably more difficult to model. Let’s try and
model a larger, more complex network, <code>faux.magnolia.high</code>
from the <code>{ergm}</code> package. Load it, call up the
documentation, and visualise the giant component.</p>

<p>So we now have 1461 vertices and 974 edges We also have four
attributes: grade, race, sex and vertex.names Let’s pick up where we
left off, with fitting a covariate-based model:</p>

</div>
<p>Looks like there are some of every race, what’s the problem? Ah, so
the problem is that there are very few students in the “Other” category,
and these students form no homophilous (within-group) ties. Same with
“Hispanic” students. The empty cells are what produce the
<code>-Inf</code> estimates. To avoid this, you can remove this category
from the <code>nodematch()</code> call.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-degeneracy" class="section level3">
<h3>Degeneracy</h3>
<p>There are also more serious issues: When a model is a particularly
poor representation of the observed network, estimation may be affected.
In the worst case scenario, simulated networks will be so different from
the observed network that the algorithm fails altogether. This can occur
for two general reasons.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the simulation algorithm may fail to converge, and<br />
the sampled networks are thus not from the specified distribution.<br />
</li>
<li>the model parameters used to simulate the networks are too<br />
different from the MLE, so even though the simulation algorithm is<br />
producing a representative sample of networks, this is not the
sample<br />
that would be produced under the MLE.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more detailed discussions of model degeneracy in the ERGM
context,<br />
see papers in e.g. <em>Social Networks</em> v.29 and <em>J Stat
Software</em> v. 24.</p>
<p>Now let’s try to fit a triangle model like with the Florentine
dataset above:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="magnmark1"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>magn.mark1 &lt;- ergm(magnolia ~ edges + triangle)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Did you get an error? That’s because in the process of trying to fit
this model, the algorithm heads off into simulating networks much denser
and clustered than the observed network. This is a big problem, and such
a clear indicator of degeneracy that the algorithm cuts off to avoid
heading off into areas that would cause memory issues. Degeneracy is a
feature of how well the suggested model compares to the observed
network</p>
<p>If you have a degenerate model, there is some ‘witchcraft’ (art +
science) that can be done to tweak the way the simulations are
generated, and I can offer some assistance with that if you show me your
<code>?mcmc.diagnostics</code>, but more often than not it’s a problem
of how the model is specified.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb, if facing such an issue, is to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>make sure you include degree- or centrality-based effects in
addition to closure-based effects like triangles;</li>
<li>use geometrically weighted or alternating forms of both centrality
(<code>gwdegree</code>) and closure/triangle (<code>gwesp</code>)
effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>So let’s try that now:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="magnstr" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>magn.str &lt;- ergm(magnolia ~ edges + gwdegree(0.25, fixed = T) + 
                     gwesp(0.25, fixed = T))
plot(magn.str)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Excellent, now we’re getting somewhere! It converged, not bad.
Everything is highly significant, and both gwdeg and gwesp are positive.
A positive gwdegree effect generally means that preferential attachment
is operating. A positive gwesp effect generally means that there is
closure. By fixing the alpha for each at 0.25, we’re saying that
successive contributions to the statistic matter less though (which
helps us avoid suuper dense networks, etc.)</p>
<p>But we don’t want to just see whether there is an aggregation of ties
around particular nodes (positive gwdegree) and collections of ties
(positive gwesp), we want to know whether e.g. this is really
preferential attachment – an endogenous effect – or could it be just
that the ties are collating around particular nodes because of their
attributes. That’s why we also need to model these as a multivariate
model together with these possibly confounding variables/alternative
explanations.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="magnattr" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>magn.attr &lt;- ergm(magnolia ~ edges + gwesp(0.25,fixed=T) + gwdegree(0.25,fixed=T) + 
                     nodematch(&#39;Grade&#39;) +   nodematch(&#39;Race&#39;) + nodematch(&#39;Sex&#39;))
plot(magn.attr)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Success! (though one could maybe increase the MCMC sample size and/or
interval) In practice it might take more trial and error to find this
solution…</p>
<p>So now we have a final model for (the main component of the) Magnolia
high school. What does the model say? Everything is significant and
positive, suggesting that all this matters. But that there are still
significant effects for gwdegree and gwesp, even as we control for
grade, race, and sex homophily, suggests that these statistically
significant effects may represent endogenous effects over and beyond
what can be explained by the other variables and indicating that there
may be such network mechanisms as ties collecting around already popular
nodes or joining two-paths operating here.</p>
<p>Now that you have a fitted model, let’s see how well it fits:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="magnfit" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>magn.attr.gof &lt;- gof(magn.attr,  GOF = ~ degree + distance + triadcensus + espartners - model)

</div>
<p>Looks ok, though there’s still some over and underestimation, so
there’s room for improvement… Let’s also compare a simulated network
with the observed network</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="magsim" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>magn.sim1 &lt;- simulate(magn.attr)
graphr(magnolia, node_color = &quot;Grade&quot;, node_size = 0.2, labels = FALSE) + 
  ggtitle(&quot;Observed&quot;) +
  graphr(magn.sim1, node_color = &quot;Grade&quot;, node_size = 0.2, labels = FALSE) + 
  ggtitle(&quot;Simulated&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Note: if all else fails, simulated networks can help diagnose
problems</p>
<p>Task 3: Run an ERGM on the Florentine business network with terms
capturing centrality, cohesion, and the influence of monadic (nodal) and
dyadic covariates all at once. Check convergence and fit and interpret
the results.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="flob" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>flob &lt;- ergm(flobusiness ~ edges + gwdegree(0.25, fixed = T) + gwesp(0.25, fixed = T) +

</div>
<p>What can we tell from this? Model convergence: Convergence test
p-value: 0.0080. Converged with 99% confidence. Edges (-), gwesp (+),
and marriage (+) were statistically significant. The probability of
seeing a tie is much higher when nodes are already connected through a
marriage tie!</p>
